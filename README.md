**Forecasting Stock Price Prediction using Time Series Analysis**

**Description:**

This repository contains code and resources for forecasting stock prices using time series analysis techniques. Time series forecasting plays a crucial role in financial markets for making informed investment decisions. In this project, we leverage popular Python libraries such as pandas, NumPy, statsmodels, and pmdarima to analyze historical stock price data, build time series forecasting models, and predict future stock prices.

**Key Features:**

- **Data Analysis:** Explore historical stock price data using pandas and visualize trends using matplotlib and seaborn.
  
- **Model Development:** Utilize time series analysis techniques including AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Exponential Smoothing methods for forecasting stock prices.
  
- **Model Evaluation:** Assess the performance of forecasting models using metrics like Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and others.
  
- **Web Deployment:** Deploy the trained forecasting model using Flask to create an interactive web interface where users can input a date and get a prediction of the stock price.

**Contents:**

- **Python Scripts:** Contains Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.
  
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** Includes Jupyter notebooks for detailed analysis, experimentation, and documentation.
  
- **Dataset:** Sample dataset containing historical stock price data used for model training and evaluation.
  
- **Documentation:** Documentation files providing instructions, explanations, and insights into the project.
